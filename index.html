    In my opinion this are the most 3 sports watched by people in the world:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h1>Fotball</h1>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Basketball</h2>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Formula</h3>
        </li>

    </ol>

    For me ,I'm a football fan ,not a basketball or formula fan.So we're gonna talk about football here.<br>
    First of all name the top 10 teams in the world (not necessarily in order):
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <table>
                    <ul>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <li>Real Madrid</li>
                                <li>Manchester United</li>
                                <li>Manchester City</li>
                                <li>Barcelona</li>
                                <li>Bayern</li>
                            </td>
                        </tr>

                </table>

                </ul>
            </td>
            <td>
                <table>
                    <ul>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <li>Dortmund</li>
                                <li>Arsenal</li>
                                <li>Liverpool</li>
                                <li>Chelsea</li>
                                <li>Atletico Madrid</li>


                            </td>
                        </tr>
                </table>

                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    football and they have one of the best coach ever in Football.
